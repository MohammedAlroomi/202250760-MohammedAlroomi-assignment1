## Project Description

A responsive personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases my background, academic projects, professional experience, and contact information — designed with a dark/light theme, mobile-first layout, and smooth interactive features.

**Sections included:**
- **Hero** — Name, tagline, and an interactive terminal widget
- **About** — Personal introduction and achievements
- **Projects** — Three academic projects (Data Science, AI, Database Systems)
- **Experience** — Internship, McKinsey program, and Student Advisory Council
- **Contact** — Validated contact form and contact details

**Key Features:**
- Dark / Light theme toggle with preference saved via `sessionStorage`
- Time-based greeting (morning / afternoon / evening / night)
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Scroll-triggered fade-in animations using `IntersectionObserver`
- Contact form with real-time validation
- Fully responsive using CSS Grid and Flexbox across desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Setup Instructions

No build tools or dependencies required — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedAlroomi/202250760-MohammedAlroomi-assignment1.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder:**
   ```bash

## AI Usage Summary

Two AI tools were used during this assignment:

- **Claude (claude.ai)** — Primary tool for code generation, debugging, code review, UI/UX suggestions, and documentation drafting.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — Used for concept clarification, including understanding `IntersectionObserver`, CSS Grid vs Flexbox, and `sessionStorage` vs `localStorage`.

All AI-generated output was reviewed, tested, and customized with my own information, creative decisions, and modifications. See [`docs/ai-usage-report.md`](docs/ai-usage-report.md) for the full detailed report.
